# Living Dead
A Unity based First Person Shooter game with Normal and Zombie modes built with Unity terrain using raycasting for shooting and the core mechanics you'd expect in an FPS with available item pick-ups. Enemies use AI navigation and precise pathfinding to chase down the player.

Implemented my algorithms for AI pathfinding, navigation, raycasting, and other mechanics. Online free assets were mostly used excluding some which've been self-designed customly.

The game is PC (can also be customizable and exported for other platforms). Open this project with Unity and choose build target in build settings to export runnable and play.

###### Note 
Developed with Unity 2020.3.24f1.

## Playing guide

- Hunt down all the enemies in the terrain by finding them to win before timer ends.
- Ammo pickups for guns and medikit pickup for the players health are available at certain places in the map.
- Two guns are available, Pistol, Machine gun and grenades with some pre-loaded bullets. To change between guns, use the scroller of your mouse.
